# Murder-She-Note-HW11
This app aims to allow users to write and save notes. It uses Express.js for its back-end and is designed to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. As the application already has some starter code(front-end side completeded), I am tasked with developing the back end, connecting the back end to the front end, and then deploying the entire application to Heroku.
