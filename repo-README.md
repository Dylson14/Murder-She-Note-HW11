# Murder-She-Note-HW11
This app aims to allow users to write and save notes. It uses Express.js for its back-end and is designed to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. As the application already has some starter code(front-end side completeded), I am tasked with developing the back end, connecting the back end to the front end, and then deploying the entire application to Heroku.

The majority of this will be performed through express methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. With the creation of routes we can connect the front-end side of the platform to the backend. The backend primarily tasked with storing the information inside of a database (db.json) where it can be saved and ultimatly sent back to the client on the front end.
